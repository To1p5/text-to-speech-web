AUDIO PLAYBACK ISSUES ANALYSIS

1. Multiple Playback Instances Issue
Problem: Multiple audio streams playing simultaneously when play/pause button is pressed repeatedly
Root Cause: 
- Current implementation starts a new playback thread each time play is called
- No proper cleanup of previous playback threads
- The play_obj and playback_thread aren't properly synchronized
Solution Needed:
- Implement proper thread management
- Add mutex/lock for playback control
- Ensure previous playback is fully stopped before starting new one

2. Speed Change Causes Audio Stop
Problem: Audio stops when changing speed
Root Cause:
- Current implementation regenerates the entire audio file when speed changes
- No continuous playback during speed adjustment
- Position tracking is lost during speed change
Solution Needed:
- Implement real-time speed adjustment without regeneration
- Maintain playback position during speed changes
- Use buffer-based approach like in AudioPlaybackUtils.kt

3. Delayed Initial Playback
Problem: Long delay between audio file creation and playback availability
Root Cause:
- Multiple file operations (WAV creation, loading, conversion)
- Sample rate conversion happening after file creation
- No streaming/buffering implementation
Solution Needed:
- Implement streaming audio processing
- Optimize file operations
- Consider using a buffer-based approach

4. Seek Bar Issues
Problem: Seeking resets to beginning instead of selected position
Root Cause:
- Current seek implementation stops and restarts playback
- Position tracking not properly maintained during seek
- No proper buffering of audio data
Solution Needed:
- Implement proper seeking without full restart
- Maintain audio buffer for quick seeking
- Better position tracking

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:

1. Audio Generation Pipeline:
   - WAV file creation (pyttsx3)
   - File loading (soundfile)
   - Sample rate conversion (numpy)
   - Playback (simpleaudio)
Issues:
- Too many file operations
- No streaming capability
- Excessive memory usage

2. Playback Control:
   - Thread-based playback
   - Global state management
   - File-based audio handling
Issues:
- Poor thread synchronization
- No proper state management
- Inefficient resource handling

3. Speed Control:
   - Requires full audio regeneration
   - Loses playback position
   - No real-time adjustment
Issues:
- Inefficient implementation
- Poor user experience
- Resource intensive

RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:

1. Replace Current Implementation:
   - Use a proven audio library (e.g., PyDub or sounddevice)
   - Implement buffer-based playback
   - Use proper thread synchronization

2. Alternative Approach:
   - Adapt AudioPlaybackUtils.kt approach:
     * Proper state management
     * Buffer-based playback
     * Real-time speed control
     * Efficient seeking

3. Immediate Fixes Needed:
   - Implement proper thread cleanup
   - Add mutex locks for playback control
   - Improve position tracking
   - Optimize file operations

4. Long-term Improvements:
   - Switch to streaming audio processing
   - Implement proper buffering
   - Use event-based state management
   - Add proper error handling

NEXT STEPS:
1. Implement proper thread management
2. Add mutex locks for playback control
3. Research and integrate a more robust audio library
4. Consider porting AudioPlaybackUtils.kt functionality to Python
5. Implement proper state management
6. Add comprehensive error handling
